# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug

This repository demonstrates a common Java bug: an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` caused by incorrect loop iteration.

The `bug.java` file contains a for loop that attempts to access an array index beyond its valid range, leading to the exception.

The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the loop, ensuring safe array access.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking loop conditions when working with arrays in Java to avoid runtime errors.
